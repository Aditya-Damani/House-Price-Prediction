# House Price Prediction using XGBoost
This project involves predicting house prices using the California Housing dataset from sklearn. The project employs an XGBoost regressor to build and evaluate the model.

# Dataset
The California Housing dataset is used for this project. It contains features describing different aspects of housing data such as median income, house age, number of rooms, population, etc. The target variable is the median house value.

# Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the dataset, inspect it for missing values, and perform basic statistical analysis.
2. Correlation Analysis: Visualize correlations between features using a heatmap.
3. Model Training: Train the XGBoost regressor model on the training data.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using R-squared error and Mean Absolute Error on both training and test data.
5. Visualization: Visualize the relationship between actual and predicted house prices.
